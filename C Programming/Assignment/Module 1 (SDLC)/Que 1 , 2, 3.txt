Que-1: What is Software? What is Software Engineering?

Answer: 

Software: It is a set of instructions, data or programs
	  used to operate computer and execute specific tasks.
	 
	  Software is a generic term used to refer to applications,
	  scripts and programs that run on a device.

Software Engineering: Software Engineering is a systematic engineering
		      approach to software development.
		      
                      It is the application of priciples used in the 
		      field of engineering, which usually deals with 
		      physical systems, to the design, development, 
		      testing, deployment and management of software
		      systems.

Que-2: Explain types of Softwares.

Answer: 

There is Two types of Softwares.
1) System Software
2) Application Software

1) System Software: 

It is usually defined as a set of various programs or instructions 
that help to control or manage the hardware devices connected to 
the computer and other important resources of the system.
			
Specifically, it helps in making the working of the computer efficient,
enables faster performance in a secure manner.
 
In addition, the system software also establishes a platform to run the
application software.
 
Some examples of system software are as follows:

Operating system: MS Windows,Android,IOS,Linux,MacOS,etc.  
Device Drivers: BIOS,Sound Card,Display,USb drivers,etc.
Firmware: BIOS,UEFI,Embedded systems,computer peripherals,etc.
Language Translators: Interpreter,Compiler,Assembler,etc.
Utility: Winrar,Antivirus,etc.

	
2) Application Software:

Application software refers to a set of programs and instructions
that help perform specific tasks, on a computer system. It is mainly
designed to meet certain requirements of aparticular environment.

Application software can be downloaded and install manually on the
computer system and these software have nothing to do with the system
core functions.
 
Application software typically runs in the front-end,making it more
accessible and interactable to users. 

Some examples of application software are as follows:

Word processors: MS Word, Google docs,etc.
Database software: MS access, MySQL,etc.
Multimedia software: VLC, Picasa, Adobe photoshop,etc.
Graphics software: GIMP, MS Paint, CorelDraw,etc.
Web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,MS Edge,etc.

Que-3: What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.

Answer:

It is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality,
low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time.

The goal of the SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and 
exceeds all customer expectations and demands.

There are 7 phases of SDLC:

Phase 1: Requirement collection and analysis 
	
	This stage gives a clearer picture of the scope the entire 
	project and the anticipated issues,opportunities, and 
	directives which triggered the project.

	Requirements Gathering stage need teams to get detailed and 
	precise requirements. This helps companies to finalize the
	necessary timeline to finish the work of that system. 

Phase 2: Feasibility study
	
	Once the requirement analysis phase is completed the next sdlc 
	step is to define and document software needs. 
	
	This process conducted with the help of ‘Software Requirement 
	Specification’ document also known as ‘SRS’ document. It 
	includes everything which should be designed and developed 
	during the project life cycle.

	There are five types of feasibility checks:
	1. Economic
	2. Legal
	3. Operation feasibility
	4. Technical
	5. Schedule

Phase 3: Design

	In this third phase, the system and software design documents
	are prepared as per the requirement specification document.
	This helps define overall system architecture.

	This design phase serves as input for the next phase of the 
	model.

	
Phase 4: Coding/Developemment

	Once the system desgin phase is over, the next phase is coding.
	In this phase, developers start build the entire system by 
	writing code by using the chosen programming language. In the 
	coding phase, tasks are divided into units or modules and 
	assigned to the various developers. It is the longest phase of
	the software developement life cycl process.
	
	In this phase, Developer needs to follow certain predefined
	coding guidelines. They also need to use programming tools
	like compiler, interpreter, debugger to generate and implement
	the code.

Phase 5: Testing 
	
	Once the software is complete, and it is deployed in testing
	environment. The testing team starts testing the functionality
	of the entire system. This is done to verify that the entire 
	application works according to the cutomer requirement.
	
	During this phase, QA and testing team may find some bugs/defects
	which they communicates to developer. The developement team fixes 
	the bug and send back to QA for a re-test. This process continues
	until the software is bug-free, stable and working according to 
	the business needs of that system.

Phase 6: Installation/Deployment

	Once the software testing phase is over and no bugs or errors
	left in the system then the final deployment process starts.
	Based on the feedback given by the project manager, the final
	software is released and checked for the deployment issues if
	any.


Phase 7: Maintenance
	
	Once the system is deployed, and customer start using the 
	developed system, following 3 activities ocuur:

	Bug fixing - bugs are reported because of some scenarios 
		     which are not tested at all

	Upgrade - Upgrading the application to the newer versions of 
		  the software
	
	Enhancement - Adding some new features into the existing software

	
	The main focus of this SDLC phase is to ensure that needs continue 
	to be met and that the system continues to perform as per the
	specification mentioned in the first phase.
