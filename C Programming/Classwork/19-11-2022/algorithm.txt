Algorithms : It is a process of following step-by-step 
	     is called Algorithms.


Que.1 Create an algorithm of making a Tea.
Steps:

step 1: Start.(Turn the stove on)
step 2: Take the inputs.(Container,water,tea,sugar,etc.)
step 3: Process.(Boiling)
step 4: Testing.(If tea is good, then go to next step else start again)
step 5: Output.(Serve)
step 6: Stop.


Que.2 Create an algorithm to take two inputs and add them.
Steps:

step 1: Start Program.
step 2: Take input A and input B from user.
step 3: If A & B both are integers, add them else addition is not 
	possible start again.
step 4: Show the addition.
step 5: Stop.
